# TOP-Battleship

ToDo:

Update Text UI
- /// Fix Turn Display, probably just inverse /// Remove Entirely
- /// Create a simple Turn Indicator pointing to whichever screen is active - Wait / Go
- /// Update Hits Remaining Counter - Works for Enemy Attacks
- /// Remove Player One/Two - Your Fleet/Enemy Fleet is enough indication 

Update aesthetic
- Potentially go with old school metal and bevels with Hazard stripes :P

- /// Fix Player ships not turning red on hit
- /// Work on end state when all ships destroyed
- /// Create Prompt that all ships are destroyed
- /// Potentially refine ai to choose recursively closer squares after a hit

- Refined  Hit AI at the moment only holds that knowledge for one round, potentially allow it to remember
hits and keep attacking near there
- /// Create Reset Game Loop
- /// Hide Enemy Ships for Player
- Create Random Placement of fleet at start
- Allow Vertical ship placement
