# TOP-Battleship

// Set up process

- Create a template class for ships
-- Each class should be an object with properties:
--- length (int)
--- number of times hit (int)
--- sunk or not (bool)

function takeHit()
{
    number of times hit ++;

    isSunk();

}

function isSunk()
{
     if number of times hit = length
    {
        sunk = true
    }
}
