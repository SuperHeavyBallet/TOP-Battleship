# TOP-Battleship

ToDo:

Update Text UI
- /// Fix Turn Display, probably just inverse /// Remove Entirely
- /// Create a simple Turn Indicator pointing to whichever screen is active - Wait / Go
- /// Update Hits Remaining Counter - Works for Enemy Attacks
- /// Remove Player One/Two - Your Fleet/Enemy Fleet is enough indication 

Update aesthetic
- /// Potentially go with old school metal and bevels
- /// Create UI elements to represent actual ships and their hit status

- /// Fix Player ships not turning red on hit
- /// Work on end state when all ships destroyed
- /// Create Prompt that all ships are destroyed
- /// Potentially refine ai to choose recursively closer squares after a hit

- Refined  Hit AI at the moment only holds that knowledge for one round, potentially allow it to remember
hits and keep attacking near there
- /// Create Reset Game Loop
- /// Hide Enemy Ships for Player
- /// Create Random Placement of fleet at start - Pseudo Random, pick from list
- /// Prevent player and enemy ship placement to be the same, player can guess positions
- /// Allow Vertical ship placement

UI UPdates
- /// Remove Hits Remaining - Serves no purpose now
- /// Replace Wait/Go with red/green light(circle);
- /// Move Your/Enemy Fleet to below board, above ship UI

- Add another 3x ship < -- Push to later, heavy refactor chasing>
- /// Update Wait/Go text on Win Lose
- !!!Update ENEMY SHIPS to DESTROYED on Win - No Gain
- !!!Update YOUR SHIPS to DESTROYED on Lose - No Gain
- /// Update PLAY AGAIN to always Present, text RELOAD until Win/Lose
