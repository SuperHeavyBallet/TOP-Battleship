# TOP-Battleship

ToDo:

Update Text UI
- /// Fix Turn Display, probably just inverse /// Remove Entirely
- /// Create a simple Turn Indicator pointing to whichever screen is active - Wait / Go
- /// Update Hits Remaining Counter - Works for Enemy Attacks
- /// Remove Player One/Two - Your Fleet/Enemy Fleet is enough indication 

Update aesthetic
- Potentially go with old school metal and bevels with Hazard stripes :P

- /// Fix Player ships not turning red on hit
- Work on end state when all ships destroyed
- Create Prompt that all ships are destroyed
- Potentially refine ai to choose recursively closer squares after a hit
